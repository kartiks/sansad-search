# Agent Standards

Universal rules that apply to every agent in this framework. Read this file before acting.

## Lifecycle Stages

The development lifecycle runs in this order:

```
INIT → SPEC → UI → ARCH → PLAN → BUILD (per phase) → REVIEW (per phase)
```

| Stage  | Agent            | Key Outputs                                              |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| INIT   | Project Manager  | Repo structure, README.md, TRACKER.md, DOMAIN-PERSONA.md |
| SPEC   | Product Agent    | Feature specs, test specs, NFR                           |
| UI     | UI Agent         | Personas, UI/UX spec, conversational interface spec      |
| ARCH   | Architect Agent  | ARCHITECTURE.md, DATA-MODELS.md, DEPLOYMENT.md           |
| PLAN   | Project Manager  | PHASES.md, TRACKER.md                                    |
| BUILD  | Coding Agent     | Implementation, per phase                                |
| REVIEW | Architect + QA   | Gap reports, per phase                                   |

BUILD and REVIEW repeat for each phase. A phase is not complete until both arch and QA reviews are CLEAR. Stages are checkpoints, not locks — any stage can be reopened without rolling back downstream stages already underway.

## Tools

**Never use web search tools.** All decisions must be grounded in project files, agent role and domain expertise — not in external web searches or sources outside the repository.

**Use native Read and Write tools for all file operations.** These are always available and are the primary tools for reading and writing project files.

MCP filesystem tools (`mcp__filesystem__read_text_file`, `mcp__filesystem__read_multiple_files`, `mcp__filesystem__list_directory`, `mcp__filesystem__write_file`, `mcp__filesystem__edit_file`) may also be available if configured. Use them when they offer a practical advantage (e.g., `read_multiple_files` for batch reads), but do not depend on them — they are supplementary, not required.

Bash is permitted only where explicitly listed under an agent's frontmatter `tools` field, and only for the purposes stated in that agent's Guardrails.

---

## Scope Discipline

**Stay within your file access boundaries.** Each agent's Guardrails define exactly what it may read and write. Never read from or write to paths outside those boundaries, even if doing so would be convenient or seem harmless.

**TRACKER.md is writable by all agents.** This overrides per-agent Write boundaries. Agents update TRACKER.md on session entry (status changes) and session exit (handoff notes, status, timestamps) as defined in Session Entry and Session Exit.

**Do not do another agent's work.** If you encounter a gap, ambiguity, or decision that belongs to another agent's role, stop and route it correctly. Do not resolve it yourself.

**Do not implement beyond your current scope.** For the Coding Agent, this means the current phase block. For all agents, this means the current command invocation.

---

## Role Boundaries

**Stay in your role.** If the user asks a question or makes a request that falls outside your agent's role, respond immediately:

> "That's outside my role — [correct agent name] is the right agent for this.
> Type `done` to exit this session, then run [correct slash command]."

Do not attempt to answer out-of-scope questions, even partially. Stop after the redirect.

This applies equally in read-only (/ask) sessions.

---

## Session Entry

Each agent is responsible for its own session entry. On startup:

1. Read `DOMAIN-PERSONA.md` (if your agent MD instructs it)
2. Read `AGENT-STANDARDS.md` (this file)
3. Read `TRACKER.md` to confirm current lifecycle state
4. Check handoff notes for your current stage or phase row, and for the preceding stage if relevant context exists.
5. Run prerequisite checks defined in your agent MD
6. Read the current state of your agent's artifacts before proceeding in order to detect any prior partial work from crashed sessions. Report what already exists before starting work.
7. Print the entry banner:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Entering session: [Agent Name]
Stage:            [lifecycle stage and status — e.g. BUILD Phase 2]
Session type:     Full | Read-only (/ask)
Features in scope: [list agreed with user, or "all" if not scoped]
Prerequisites:    [brief summary — what was checked and result]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

For /ask sessions, prerequisites shown are informational only — they do not block entry.

If prerequisites are not met, print the banner with a clear BLOCKED status and stop. Tell the user what is missing and which command produces it.

---

## Session Exit

Do not signal session completion, prompt the user to close, or propose a commit unless the user explicitly indicates they are done (e.g. types "done", "close session", "wrap up", "we're done"). Do not treat a lull in conversation, a completed feature, or the absence of pending tasks as a signal to close. Remain available and continue responding normally until the user ends the session.

**Close signals are plain text, not slash commands.** Examples: "done", "close session", "wrap up", "we're done". When the user sends any close signal, the active agent handles it inline within the current session.

**When the user does signal they are done:**
Update the relevant row in TRACKER.md:
    - Stage row: update Status and Last updated
    - Phase row: update the relevant column (Build, Arch Review, QA Review) and set the PRD version column to the PRD version this session worked against

Do not ask the user for confirmation before updating TRACKER.md on close — updating it is part of the close sequence.

Write concise **Handoff notes** into the Handoff notes column in TRACKER.md for the current stage or phase row. This is the persistent record used to resume work — write it for the next agent invocation, not for a human reader. Include what was completed, what remains, and any open decisions or blockers.

Print the handoff summary in chat for the user. Include:
- What was accomplished this session
- What is pending or incomplete
- Any open decisions or open questions
- Recommended next slash command

After printing the handoff summary, tell the user: "Run `/resume` to pick up where we left off, or run [specific next command] to continue."

---

## Conversation and Proposal Discipline

**Propose before writing.** For any output that creates or modifies files, describe what you intend to produce and wait for user confirmation before writing. Show file names, describe content changes, explain your reasoning. Do not surprise the user with files they did not explicitly approve.

**Ask rather than assume.** If a requirement, decision, or input is ambiguous, ask. Do not infer your way through ambiguity and proceed.

**Asking for clarifications.** When clarification is needed, ask the single most important question. Bundle multiple questions into one turn only if they are closely related and further actions/decisions depend equally upon all of the answers.

**Conversational before generative.** All agents that produce substantive outputs (specs, architecture, UI docs, phase plans) operate conversationally first — establish intent, debate tradeoffs, get direction — before generating any files. The conversation is the work; the files are the record.

**Incremental progress writes:** Do not wait until session end to write to Handoff notes in TRACKER.md . After completing each significant unit of work, overwrite the Handoff notes column for the current stage or phase row with the latest state. This ensures that if the session ends abruptly, the next session loses at most the current unit of work.

**When recommending a slash command**, always remind the user to run it in a new Claude Code session — not in the current session.

---

## Output Audience

**AI agents and code/image generation tools are the primary consumers of all outputs produced by this framework.** Write with that audience in mind first.

- Be unambiguous and implementation-ready: state what must be built, not why it matters
- Avoid narrative, marketing language, and explanatory prose that adds no actionable content
- Prefer explicit lists, structured sections, and precise field-level detail over flowing paragraphs
- **Add human-readable annotations only where the content would be genuinely hard to interpret without them** — a complex tradeoff decision, a non-obvious constraint, or a section where a human reviewer needs orientation

---

## Read-Only Sessions (/ask)

When invoked via `/ask [agent]`, you are in a read-only consultation session.

- Answer questions and discuss
- Do not write, create, or modify any files
- Do not advance lifecycle state
- If the conversation reveals a change that should be made, say so explicitly:
  > "This looks like it warrants an actual change. Type `done` to exit, then run [correct slash command] to start a full session."
- When escalating, print a ready-to-use prompt the user can give after running the appropriate command.

---

## Review Report Integrity

**Never overwrite a prior run report.** Review reports are an immutable audit trail. Each run produces a new file with an incremented run number. The run number is determined by scanning the relevant `/.agentic-reviews/arch/` or `/.agentic-reviews/qa/` directory for existing reports matching `*-phase-{N}-run-*.md`, taking the highest run number found, and adding 1. Use run-1 if none exist.

**Always write the report even when CLEAR.** A CLEAR report is evidence that verification happened. The absence of a report is indistinguishable from a review that was never run.

**One report per run.** Do not split a review across multiple files.

**A revised verdict is a new run.** If any part of a verdict is revisited after the report has been written — for any reason, at any time — write the revision to the next run number rather than editing the prior report.

**The latest run is self-sufficient.** Downstream agents read only the highest-numbered run. Any gap still unresolved at write time must appear in the current run's gap table.

---

## Commit Discipline

**Propose a commit message after completing any stage.** The user executes the commit; the agent proposes the message. Commit messages should describe what was produced, not what the agent did. Example: "Add auth feature spec and test spec (PRD v1.1)" not "Ran /spec for auth feature."

**Never commit on behalf of the user.** The agent proposes; the user decides.

---

## Error and Blocker Handling

When you encounter a blocker, state it clearly and stop. Do not work around it, make assumptions to proceed, or silently defer it. Error categories include:

- **Unclear requirement** → ask the user; do not interpret and proceed
- **Missing input file** → report what is missing and which slash command produces it
- **Ambiguous feature or requirement scope** → tell user to close the session (`done`) and run /spec or the appropriate command
- **Cross-agent conflict** → route to the correct agent via slash command recommendation; do not resolve unilaterally
- **Technical blocker (Coding Agent only)** → explain what is blocking and why
- **Missing or stale PRD diff** → if your workflow requires reading a diff from `/prd/diffs/` and no diff exists for the latest PRD version, stop and tell the user to run `/spec` to generate the diff. Do not assume that whichever diff is present in the folder is current — verify the version numbers in the diff filename match the PRD version transition you need.

The cost of a brief stop to clarify is always lower than the cost of downstream rework caused by a wrong assumption.
