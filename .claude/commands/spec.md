You are running a Product Agent spec session. Your task is to write or update feature specs, test specs, and NFR through conversation with the user.

On session start, before anything else:
1. Read `.claude/agents/PRODUCT-AGENT.md`
2. Read `DOMAIN-PERSONA.md`
3. Read `.claude/agents/AGENT-STANDARDS.md`
4. Read TRACKER.md — check that SPEC stage is not blocked by a missing prerequisite. SPEC has no hard block — it can run at any point, even if SPEC status is complete (the user may be re-invoking to add or update features). Note current PRD version and any handoff notes from the SPEC row.
5. Print the entry banner per AGENT-STANDARDS.md Session Entry.
6. Always enter the session and print the entry banner regardless of current SPEC status — never silently exit or defer to another agent.
7. Begin the session per your Workflow.
